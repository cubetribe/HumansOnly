- `/api/auth/session` now exposes a canonical session response with auth source metadata (`clerk`, `legacy`, or `null`).
- Core mutation endpoints no longer depend on client-supplied `tokenOwnerId` for authorization decisions.
- Frontend fetch layer and mutation callers were simplified to stop sending `tokenOwnerId` in request bodies.

### Fixed

### Removed

- Unused legacy login/signup dialog components from the frontend codebase.

### Added

- `Rodemap.md` with the 6-wave execution and validation plan.

### Changed

- Hardened action payload handling for legacy quoted `tokenOwnerId` values across like/repost/follow/delete routes.
- Home, Messages, and Notifications pages now fail gracefully when users are not signed in instead of hanging in loading states.
- Profile verification flow now validates the code server-side and supports partial profile updates without clearing media.
- API CORS now uses a concrete allowed origin (`NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL`) for credentialed requests.

### Fixed

- Restored frontend/backend ID contract for like/repost/follow/delete actions by removing `JSON.stringify` ID transport in client components.
- Corrected tweet pagination metadata by counting only non-reply posts in `/api/tweets/all`.
- Restricted `/api/upload` to authenticated users only.
- Redacted hardcoded production credentials/secrets from deployment documentation.

  - `scripts/deploy-server.sh` (manual deploy parity script)
- New agent workflow artifacts for UX/deploy hardening:
  - `Agents/RESEARCHER_brief-2026-02-27-ux.md`
  - `Agents/ARCHITECT_spec-2026-02-27-ux.md`

### Changed

- Tweet and single-post views now convert `@username` text into profile links.
- Share interaction now uses native Web Share API when available, with clipboard fallback.
- Like/repost/follow/delete action payloads standardized to object format (`{ tokenOwnerId }`) with route-level backward compatibility.
- Sidebar unauthenticated CTA now uses Clerk modal buttons directly.
- Deploy docs updated with GitHub secrets and auto-deploy flow.

### Fixed

- Added deploy health-check retry loop to prevent false negatives immediately after PM2 restart.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Clerk App Router integration (`@clerk/nextjs`) with:
  - `src/proxy.ts` using `clerkMiddleware()`

- `ClerkAuthBridge` client sync component to issue/clear legacy JWT cookie based on Clerk session
- Prisma migration `20260227121000_add_clerk_id_to_user` with optional unique `User.clerkId`
- New stabilization scripts:
  - `scripts/baseline-check.sh`
  - `scripts/auth-smoke-local.sh`

### Changed
