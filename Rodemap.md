# Humans Only - Rodemap

Last updated: 2026-03-03  
Owner: Codex + Dennis  
Current app version: `1.12.0`

## Goal
Build Humans Only into a production-grade, humans-only social network with enforceable authenticity controls, moderator tooling, and reliable production operations.

## Current Status Snapshot
- Waves `0-6`: completed and validated in production hardening cycles.
- Wave `7` (Human Authenticity): actively advanced, core foundation is working in production code.
- Latest completed milestone:
  - adaptive challenge enforcement (`trusted` fallback to `pending_review`)
  - explicit block responses (`403 authenticity_blocked`)
  - appeals backbone (API + settings UI)
- Mandatory validation gate remains:
  - lint
  - build
  - Prisma validate + migration status
  - smoke scripts (including `human-layer-smoke.sh`)

## Wave-by-Wave Delivery Status

### Wave 0 - Stabilization and Security Baseline
Status: `completed`

### Wave 1 - Auth Consolidation (Clerk-first)
Status: `completed`

### Wave 2 - Media Pipeline Hardening
Status: `completed`

### Wave 3 - Messaging and Notifications Reliability
Status: `completed`

### Wave 4 - Product Completion (Core UX)
Status: `completed`

### Wave 5 - Operations, Quality, and Observability
Status: `completed`

### Wave 6 - Live Validation and Hardening Loop
Status: `completed` (with follow-up hardening loops as needed)

### Wave 7 - Human Authenticity Foundation and Enforcement
Status: `in_progress` (advanced)

Delivered:
- Rules + acceptance flow (`/rules`, `/api/rules/current`, `/api/rules/accept`)
- Human challenge verification (`/api/human/challenge/verify`) with replay/TTL checks
- Turnstile integration in create/reply/edit composer flows
- Human gate on create/edit/reply/upload
- Trust snapshot API (`/api/me/trust`)
- Authenticity moderation queue (`/api/moderation/authenticity*`)
- Adaptive trusted fallback:
  - low-trust: fail-closed
  - trusted/high_trust: fail-open only into `pending_review`
- Explicit `block` behavior (`403`, `authenticity_blocked`)
- Initial provenance metadata persistence on uploaded media
- Appeals foundation:
  - user endpoints (`/api/me/authenticity`, `/api/authenticity/appeals`)
  - moderator appeal queue + decisions (`/api/moderation/authenticity/appeals*`)
  - Settings UI sections for user appeal submission and moderator appeal handling

Still open in Wave 7:
- Appeal SLA policy + automation (currently manual processing)
- Better user-facing appeal UX than prompt-based reason input
- Additional anti-abuse/rate-limit hardening on appeal submission endpoints
- Route/API docs sync for newly added appeals endpoints

### Wave 8 - Provenance + Trust Expansion
Status: `not started` (partially scaffolded)

Planned:
- Full C2PA/content-credentials parsing and verification chain
- Neutral provenance badges in UI (`verified`, `unknown`, `invalid`)
- Passkey/WebAuthn signal integration into trust scoring (currently placeholder `passkeyEnrolled=false`)

### Wave 9 - Moderation Automation + Compliance
Status: `not started`

Planned:
- Calibration loop for thresholds using moderator outcomes
- Appeals SLA tracking and queue prioritization
- Compliance flows (incl. transparency/labeling obligations by August 2, 2026)
- Controlled rollout strategy (`10% -> 50% -> 100%`) with safety metrics

## Immediate Next Priorities
1. Phase 0.2 metrics hardening:
   - expand product event coverage to notifications/messages/profile updates
   - wire admin KPI endpoint into a dedicated analytics section in Settings/Admin
   - define and document weekly KPI review cadence with thresholds
2. Harden and document appeals lifecycle end-to-end (API docs + operational runbook + moderator SOP).
3. Integrate passkey signal from Clerk into trust engine and adaptive challenge frequency.
4. Replace lightweight provenance heuristics with proper C2PA verification path.
5. Add stricter abuse controls (rate limiting + anomaly flags) for challenge and appeal routes.

## Versioning and Release Policy
- Every meaningful milestone updates:
  - `app/package.json` version
  - `app/src/version.ts`
  - `app/version`
  - changelogs
- Only validated milestones are committed/pushed.
- Pushes remain gated by explicit confirmation.
